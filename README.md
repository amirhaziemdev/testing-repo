# testing-repo
Repo for all computer vision code prior to using GitHub, also for testing GitHub functionalities for synchronising with the Mechatronics Department workflow

This repo includes:
1) Heavy OpenCV usage with Python for:
    - mould detection and serial comms for moving conveyors
    - feature matching algorithms for Mercedes car doors
    - marking detection, recognition, and measurement
    - general image processing: binarisation, thresholding, colour conversion, contours, etc.
    - drawing virtual markings on an image to indicate recognition
    
2) Graphical user interface (GUI) dev code for:
    - object detection algorithms on desktop (TXIS dev)
    - IP camera usage with minimum latency (failed)
    - creating terminals for RS232 serial communication with the object detection system (tested with virtual serial ports)

3) General Python codes for:
    - data processing
    - robotic process automation
    - camera testing
